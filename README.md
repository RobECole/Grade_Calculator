# Grade_Calculator

Mobile Devices Major Assignment

The purpose of this project was to create an application in Android Studio that demonstrates as many topics as possible from the course. With this in mind, we decided to create an application the demonstrated an understanding in the following topics:

- User interface design
- Intents
- Use of internet resources and asynchronous tasks
- Saving state in a text file
- Database creation and access
- Playing media files

The application is able to record the users semester, the courses they are taking, and the courses marking scheme. As the user enters the marks they receive in the course, the application calculates their current grade in that course in relation to the whole courses rubric.
